# Simulating & Graphing Solutions to Differential Equations
Contains a few simple Python notebooks for simulating and plotting trajectories of ordinary differential equations in Python 3, as well as generating vector fields in 2D and 3D. Admittedly old and quite naive code; looking back upon it, some of the style is simply dreadful.
